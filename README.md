# 3D Illumination and Shading

3D Illumination and Shading starter code using the HTML5 WebGL2 API

This programis designed to show different lighting systems and renderers work. Using WEBGL, this program was able to take the information for a 3d rendered scene as a JSON file and then take that info and, suning WebGL, send the data to the GPU where each vertex and pixel are then positioned and colored correctly depending on the texture and light scource.

This is a very mathimatically complex process. however, it can be broken down into very small operations that the GPU can do extremely quickly. This allows the scene to render in real time as the user moves the camera around and changes the lighting.
